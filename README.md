# Javascript Projects
Here is where I will be posting projects that are either completed or in progress on my Javascript Journey. Take a look at my [coding journey](https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey/) if you'd like to see my process of learning.

### Pomodoro Method Timer App
I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodor Method timer with Javascript and React. The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed, a series of "Pomodoros" are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work session.

### Nested Todo App
I created this app as an exercise in the Watch and Code Premium course. The goal was to create a Todo List app that could also create nested todos.

### Calculator w/ React (wip)
I created this calculator as an exercise in the FreeCodeCamp frameworks projects. My calculator had to be similarly functioning to this one [Here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX).
