# Javascript Projects
Here is where I will be posting projects that are either completed or in progress on my Javascript Journey. Take a look at my [coding journey](https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey/) if you'd like to see my process of learning.

### Nested Todo App
I created this app as an exercise in the Watch and Code Premium course. The goal was to create a Todo List app that could also create nested todos.

### Calculator w/ React (wip)
I created this calculator as an exercise in the FreeCodeCamp frameworks projects. My calculator had to be similarly functioning to this one [Here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX). So far, so good. I only need to implement the ability for the app to display an error if the displayed solution is too long.
