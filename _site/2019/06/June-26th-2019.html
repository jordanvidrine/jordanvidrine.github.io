    <h2>June 26th 2019</h2>
    <p>Learned A LOT today. Worked with the very begginings of databases with MongoDB in the node course I am taking. I think learning mongo is going to be fun and allow me to create a lot cooler apps for my portfolio.</p>

<p>Also learned how to deploy an app to Heroku and have a working app with node on the back end ready to use and test and ship out. I also finished my stock app and pushed that to heroku today. It can be seen here: <a href="https://jbv-stock-app.herokuapp.com/">Stock App</a></p>

<p>I didnâ€™t encounter any issues today that would call for me adding the code to todays update. Overall good day!</p>
