    <h2>July 23rd 2019</h2>
    <p>Today I pushed my app in development to Heroku for testing and to show a couple of friends. It is now live at <a href="http://jbv-drawing-prompt-app.herokuapp.com">jbv-drawing-prompt-app.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>During the process I encountered a couple of CORS issues as well as some database connection issues. It made me glad that I added a console log to the mongodb connection JS file that either alerts ‘Connected To Dabase’ or ‘Could not connect to database’</p>

<p>I got everything to work by doing the following:
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Changing my links the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch()</code> calls to be relative. Ie. From <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch('localhost:3000/prompt')</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch('/prompt')</code></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">cors npm package</a> and having my express app use it by requiring it and adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">app.use(cors())</code> to my express js file.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Since my app uses DELETE and other methods that the regular cors middleware does not cover, I also had to enable ‘pre-flight’ cors to the app by adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">app.options('*',cors())</code></p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Lastly, I logged into my MongoDB atlas account and whitelisted any IP address that is trying to make a connection to the database.</p>

<p>I spent the last hour or so of my day going through more NodeJS video course work.</p>
