    <h2>July 5th & 6th 2019</h2>
    <p>Spent a couple of hours yesterday and today implementing pagination onto my site and blog. I met with a professional programmer and he had some great suggestions for what my portfolio should showcase, as well as some input for the blog.</p>

<h4 id="things-i-implemented-and-changed">Things I Implemented and Changed</h4>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The blog now shows a max of 10 posts on a single page. Each post also has a tag that tells Jekyll where to put the “Read More…” link.<br /><br />
<strong>2.</strong> The home page is now my project showcase, and at the bottom of the page, my latest 2 entries show up for anyone who is interested to read it.<br /><br />
<strong>3.</strong> I uploaded everything to my domain at <a href="www.jordanvidrine.com">jordanvidrine.com</a> for a better online presence.<br /><br />
<strong>4.</strong> I removed my github pages ‘blog’ and that all now resides on the github page for jordanvidrine.github.io<br /><br /></p>

<p>After making edits, I use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll build</code> command to build the site into normal html, css, and javascript files. I then upload that to both my github page, as well as my domain. I really like the consistency of my new site now and am pleased with the blogging functionality I put into it.</p>
