    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      <h3>July 26th & 29th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Last Friday (26th) and today (29th) I spent some time diving into the API of my favorite budgeting app. (<a href="http://www.ynab.com">YNAB!</a>)</p>

<p>I had a random idea Friday morning to explore the ability to create an app that can receive an SMS text message like “Grocery Budget Left” and then return something like “You have $63.00 left in your groceries budget.”</p>

<p>I searched and figured out I would need to use TWILIO or something similar. I ended up creating an account and going through their intro docs and was able to create a very simple example in a couple of hours. What I turned out was just hard coded budget amount that I got the ID for by reading through the YNAB docs. I sent a text to the TWILIO # and got back the amount of my grocery budget.</p>

      <h3>July 24th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Today I will be going back to the NodeJS course as I feel like I have been able to implement everything I’ve learned thus far on my own with the Drawing App.</p>

<h4 id="logging-out">Logging Out</h4>
<p>Below we setup a route to log a user out. This simply authenticates the user using an auth middleware we wrote previously. Once the user is authenticated, it checks the users list of active tokens and removes the one currently saved to the req method, which was saved there during their authentication.</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">/users/logout</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">auth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">async</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">})</span>

    <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">save</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To ‘Log Out from All Locations’ we simply remove ALL of the tokens from the token array stored in the User object, rather than the only ‘active’ one. We can do this by setting the user’s tokens to an empty array like so. <code class="highlighter-rouge">req.user.tokens = []</code></p>
