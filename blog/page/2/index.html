      <h2>June 20th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>I’ve been feeling like my front end skills (CSS) are a little lacking so I think I’ll try and start working through the <a href="https://100dayscss.com/?dayIndex=1">100 days of css</a> challenges in my spare coding time.</p>

<p>I looked over the first one today and was able to understand some of the more complex css like animations and keyframes and such. I used a .scss file and got a little more familiar with the syntax of that as well, using variables to help my code along. It is pretty much an exact copy of the code to match. I definitely could not solve this without looking over the solution.</p>

      <p><p>Spent the first part of the day working through Eloquent Javascript chapters 8-9 on error handling and the dreaded regex. Not a huge fan of working with regex as it is pretty confusing but I do understand it and its purposes.</p>

<h4 id="continued-working-on-nodejs-course">Continued working on Node.js Course</h4>
<p>In the course today I went through more of using express inside of node. It is starting to get a little complex, which I like because it causes me to stretch my thinking and helps me to not get bored.</p>

<p>The task was to create a basic app front end and backend. In the backend we created a .get(‘/weather’) route where we send a search query and we are returned the weather info in JSON for what we entered in. Here’s what that looked like.</p>

      <h2>June 18th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>I finished the Drum Machine React App and uploaded it <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io/drumMachine/index.html">here</a>. I am pretty proud of the way it came out as well. It was cool to finish this without really encountering any issues. I learned more about mouse and click events creating the app, but other than that, it was really easy.</p>

<h4 id="other-activities">Other Activities</h4>
<p>Continued learning Node.js with a udemy course. Went through using routes and began learning the basics of the Express NPM module. Used that and handlebars ‘hbs’ in Node to go through a nice templating tutorial with custom routes.</p>

      <h2>June 17th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>I started off the day working on the Drum Machine App I began work on last week. I implemented a click and drag volume knob, as well as the ability to hover over the knob and increase/decrease the volume with the mouse wheel.</p>

<p>I added audio elements to each pad, that when clicked will trigger the corresponding audio sample for the pad.</p>

      <h2>June 12th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Super productive day for me today. I went back to my Pomodoro App and finalized the look of it, as well as updated some of the code. Since I now know how to create React Apps without the bulk of installing a ton of node packages, I was able to re-format my code to upload onto my new github portfolio.</p>

      <p><p>Today I finished the calculator app to the best of my ability. I fixed all of the issues I had with it and it is now complete. Worked through chapter 3 of Build your Own Angular.</p>

      <p><p>Man, is this year flying by! I’ve got to put some time into my artspark project so this week will be a slow one for me coding-wise. This morning I wrote a little script to help my wife pick a winner for a drawing she did with her business. We had 266 email submissions as well as another 50+ Facebook &amp; Instagram submissions.</p>

      <h2>June 5th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today I spent the majority of my time coding a calculator app using a basic react setup. It was the first time I used react without installing create-react-app with npm. It was super minimal and fun to work with. I used an npm jsx converter while working on it for the desktop version. The app.js file used online is actually the converted app.js I made using JSX.</p>

      <p><p>I worked more today on the nested todo app, which is now live <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io">here.</a> I styled it and added the ability to edit todos.</p>

      <p><p>Spent the first half of the day going through 3/4 of chapter two of ‘Build your own AngularJS.’ Getting used to looking at fairly complex code and running a lot of functions in the jasmine debugger to see what exactly is going on behind the scenes.</p>
