      <p><p>Today I finished the calculator app to the best of my ability. I fixed all of the issues I had with it and it is now complete. Worked through chapter 3 of Build your Own Angular.</p>

      <p><p>Man, is this year flying by! I’ve got to put some time into my artspark project so this week will be a slow one for me coding-wise. This morning I wrote a little script to help my wife pick a winner for a drawing she did with her business. We had 266 email submissions as well as another 50+ Facebook &amp; Instagram submissions.</p>

      <h2>June 5th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today I spent the majority of my time coding a calculator app using a basic react setup. It was the first time I used react without installing create-react-app with npm. It was super minimal and fun to work with. I used an npm jsx converter while working on it for the desktop version. The app.js file used online is actually the converted app.js I made using JSX.</p>

      <h2>June 4th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>I worked more today on the nested todo app, which is now live <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io">here.</a> I styled it and added the ability to edit todos.</p>

      <h2>June 3rd 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Spent the first half of the day going through 3/4 of chapter two of ‘Build your own AngularJS.’ Getting used to looking at fairly complex code and running a lot of functions in the jasmine debugger to see what exactly is going on behind the scenes.</p>

      <h2>May 30th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Spent a couple hours working back on the nested todos exercise for the Watch and Code premium users. I was excited to FIX the issue where my nested todos were rendering BEFORE their parent element.</p>

      <p><p>Went through chapter 1 of <a href="https:// teropa.info/build-your-own-angular/">Build Your Own Angular</a> again to solidify the javascript examples and knowledge.</p>

      <h2>May 28th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>After spending the morning organizing my ArtSpark project and putting together a project timeline with EVERYTHING I need to do, I was able to code without any distraction.</p>

<p>I will be getting back to the tank/graph offshore work this Thursday. Until then I am continuing my regularly scheduled learning.</p>

      <p><p>Today I worked more on the project for Sirius I wrote about yesterday. We will be using React as well as Recharts for React which uses d3 to create modular components for charts and graphs.</p>

      <h2>May 23rd 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today was an office day for me, but I was able to put in a couple hours of coding in between tasks. Our company was approached by an oilfield company needing a webapp that can display information about their tanks in the field. They want a line graph representation of tank levels for the past 30 days.</p>
