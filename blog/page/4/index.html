      <h2>May 24th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today I worked more on the project for Sirius I wrote about yesterday. We will be using React as well as Recharts for React which uses d3 to create modular components for charts and graphs.</p>

      <h2>May 23rd 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today was an office day for me, but I was able to put in a couple hours of coding in between tasks. Our company was approached by an oilfield company needing a webapp that can display information about their tanks in the field. They want a line graph representation of tank levels for the past 30 days.</p>

      <h2>May 22nd 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today I worked more on the watch and code exercise of creating a nested todos app. I was able to render the basics of it using only javascript and jquery to get DOM elements.</p>

      <h2>May 21st 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today I worked mostly on the last two ‘beast’ exercises from <a href="https://watchandcode.com/">watch and code premium.</a> I spent a lot of time in the debugger with this one, but I finally got it. I essentially split the number given to the function into a ‘left’ and ‘right’ side of the decmial.</p>

      <h2>May 20th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Today I worked through most of the exercises in the ‘Beasts’ section of <a href="https://watchandcode.com/">Watch and Code</a>. I keep going back to this course when something im learning stumps me. I hope to finish up all of the exercises and videos by the end of next month. Once that’s done I’ll get back to the Udemy courses on Node/Mongo/React etc.</p>

      <h2>May 11th 2019</h2>
      <p><p>Worked for a couple of hours on the Customer Quote App for my generator manager. I wrote some code to validate if the form was filled out as well as used an npm package (‘email-validator’) to validate the email address entered.</p>
