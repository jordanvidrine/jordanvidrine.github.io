    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,

      <h3>July 5th & 6th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Spent a couple of hours yesterday and today implementing pagination onto my site and blog. I met with a professional programmer and he had some great suggestions for what my portfolio should showcase, as well as some input for the blog.</p>

<h4 id="things-i-implemented-and-changed">Things I Implemented and Changed</h4>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The blog now shows a max of 10 posts on a single page. Each post also has a tag that tells Jekyll where to put the “Read More…” link.<br /><br />
<strong>2.</strong> The home page is now my project showcase, and at the bottom of the page, my latest 2 entries show up for anyone who is interested to read it.<br /><br />
<strong>3.</strong> I uploaded everything to my domain at <a href="www.jordanvidrine.com">jordanvidrine.com</a> for a better online presence.<br /><br />
<strong>4.</strong> I removed my github pages ‘blog’ and that all now resides on the github page for jordanvidrine.github.io<br /><br /></p>

<p>After making edits, I use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll build</code> command to build the site into normal html, css, and javascript files. I then upload that to both my github page, as well as my domain. I really like the consistency of my new site now and am pleased with the blogging functionality I put into it.</p>

      <h3>July 3rd 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Spent the first couple of hours of my day trying to integrate pagination into this blog. It turned out very frustrating and uneventful because github pages does not support the newest jekyll pagination gem. I couldn’t for the life of me get the v1 of their gem to work either. I’ll have to look into that in some free time. Onto my node course!</p>

<h4 id="user-password-hashing-using-bcrpyt">User Password Hashing using bcrpyt</h4>
<p>We will use bcrpyt in our task-manager app (the one I’ve been creating in this course) to save hashed versions of user passwords, as opposed to the literal password string. The following code will use bcrpyt.hash() to do this.</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">bcrpyt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">bcryptjs</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
