    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,

      <h3>July 9th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Working from a great coffee shop in Lafayette today. Starting off the day reading through the asynchronous programming chapter in Eloquent Javascript. I feel fairly confident in what async functions are and how they work, but I want to read through this chapter to solidify any loose thinking in regards to that.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-11-async---eloquent-javascript">Chapter 11 Async - Eloquent Javascript</h3>
<p>The author has a sense of humor. We will be learning the ins and outs of async by writing networking functions for a fictitious crow colony that has learned how to use javascript and communicate from nest to nest by sending signals to and from each other…. interesting.</p>

<h4 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h4>
<p>One approach to async programming is to make functions that perform a slow action take a callback argument to run when the code is finished working. (We learned about this in the NodeJS course we are currently working through.) As we learned previously, this can get convoluted quickly when wanting to perform more than one async operation. The example below has two callbacks. Any more and this could lead to hard to lots of nesting and hard to read code. IE.</p>

      <h3>July 5th & 6th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Spent a couple of hours yesterday and today implementing pagination onto my site and blog. I met with a professional programmer and he had some great suggestions for what my portfolio should showcase, as well as some input for the blog.</p>

<h4 id="things-i-implemented-and-changed">Things I Implemented and Changed</h4>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The blog now shows a max of 10 posts on a single page. Each post also has a tag that tells Jekyll where to put the “Read More…” link.<br /><br />
<strong>2.</strong> The home page is now my project showcase, and at the bottom of the page, my latest 2 entries show up for anyone who is interested to read it.<br /><br />
<strong>3.</strong> I uploaded everything to my domain at <a href="www.jordanvidrine.com">jordanvidrine.com</a> for a better online presence.<br /><br />
<strong>4.</strong> I removed my github pages ‘blog’ and that all now resides on the github page for jordanvidrine.github.io<br /><br /></p>

<p>After making edits, I use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll build</code> command to build the site into normal html, css, and javascript files. I then upload that to both my github page, as well as my domain. I really like the consistency of my new site now and am pleased with the blogging functionality I put into it.</p>
