    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      <h3>July 10th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Since it’s been a couple of days since I last worked through more of the NodeJS course. I’m starting the morning off by reviewing the last hour or so of videos. Running through bcrypt password hashing usage, mongoose model middelware to run before saving anything to the database, and json web tokens.</p>

<h4 id="json-web-tokens-jwt">Json Web Tokens (jwt)</h4>
<p>Every express route we define will fall into either a ‘public’ or ‘private’ category. It will either be accessible to anyone, or sit behind authentication, and users would have to be authed to use it.</p>

<p>Our signup and login route will be the only public routes available to the user. We dont want users deleting OTHER users tasks or updating things of the sort. To do this, we will implement authentication with Json web tokens.</p>

<p>We will be using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken">jsonwebtoken</a> npm library to do all of this. Heres what a super simple implemenation could look like.</p>

      <h3>July 9th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Working from a great coffee shop in Lafayette today. Starting off the day reading through the asynchronous programming chapter in Eloquent Javascript. I feel fairly confident in what async functions are and how they work, but I want to read through this chapter to solidify any loose thinking in regards to that.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-11-async---eloquent-javascript">Chapter 11 Async - Eloquent Javascript</h3>
<p>The author has a sense of humor. We will be learning the ins and outs of async by writing networking functions for a fictitious crow colony that has learned how to use javascript and communicate from nest to nest by sending signals to and from each other…. interesting.</p>

<h4 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h4>
<p>One approach to async programming is to make functions that perform a slow action take a callback argument to run when the code is finished working. (We learned about this in the NodeJS course we are currently working through.) As we learned previously, this can get convoluted quickly when wanting to perform more than one async operation. The example below has two callbacks. Any more and this could lead to hard to lots of nesting and hard to read code. IE.</p>
