    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,
      and custom forms. We integrated google sheets and email for a reservation system allowed the client to save money
      by not using a pay per month reservation system.

      <h3>August 20th Part 2</h3>
      <p><h3 id="eloquent-javascript-chapter-16"><strong>Eloquent Javascript Chapter 16</strong></h3>
<p>In my previous post, I wrote about the resources I have been and continue to use while learning Javascript. One of the best ones has been Eloquent Javascript.</p>

<p>The latest chapter was tough, but the more I sat with it and examined the code line by line, as well as inside of a debugger, the more I understood what was going on. I went through all of the code of the chapter and ran it in the FireFox Developer debugger OVER AND OVER again! Each time I had a realization, I commented near the line of code what was happening.</p>

<p>I feel like I have a pretty good handle of how the code now works and what exactly is happening behind the scenes. I believe what I am most impressed with about this chapter, and the book in general, is just how much can be done with PURE javascript.</p>

      <h3>August 20th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Today I want to make two posts. The first of which (this one) will document what materials and courses I have been going through this year. I’ll list them out in the order that I went through them in case you’d like to do the same. It has been a steady progression of difficulty and I feel like I have learned a lot. It has not been without its ups and downs as well as pretty difficult moments, but these courses have helped solidify a lot of javascript for me.</p>
