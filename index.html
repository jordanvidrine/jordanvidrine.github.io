    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,

      <h3>August 21st</h3>
      <p><h3 id="testing-in-node-with-jest">Testing in Node with Jest</h3>
<p>For the last part of the day yesterday I began going through the testing part of the node course I am taking. I love the idea of testing and am eager to continue to learn how to use Jest in reference to node, express, and a working database.</p>

<p>Yesterday we walked through setting up a test environment, a test database, and refactoring our call to express for us to be able to use it in a testing suite. We installed Jest, as well as Supertest (helps testing with express routes without creating a server) from the NPM library.</p>

<p>A jest test looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">calculateTip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">total</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">tipPercent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">tipPercent</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Jest gives us the global variable of test, so no need to require anything</span>
<span class="nx">test</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Should calculate total with tip</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">calculateTip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">total</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toBe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">})</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

      <h3>August 20th Part 2</h3>
      <p><h3 id="eloquent-javascript-chapter-16"><strong>Eloquent Javascript Chapter 16</strong></h3>
<p>In my previous post, I wrote about the resources I have been and continue to use while learning Javascript. One of the best ones has been Eloquent Javascript.</p>

<p>The latest chapter was tough, but the more I sat with it and examined the code line by line, as well as inside of a debugger, the more I understood what was going on. I went through all of the code of the chapter and ran it in the FireFox Developer debugger OVER AND OVER again! Each time I had a realization, I commented near the line of code what was happening.</p>

<p>I feel like I have a pretty good handle of how the code now works and what exactly is happening behind the scenes. I believe what I am most impressed with about this chapter, and the book in general, is just how much can be done with PURE javascript.</p>
