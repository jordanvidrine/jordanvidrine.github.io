    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

    <h3>Nested Todolist App</h3>

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,

      <h3>August 5th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Today I’ll be getting back to the NodeJS course I am working through on Udemy. I feel like I have learned a really good amount of great information from this course. I’ve been able to personally use every piece of knowledge from this course into various personal apps and experiments since I started the course.</p>

<h3 id="sorting-pagination--filtering-in-mongoosemongodb">Sorting, Pagination, &amp; Filtering in Mongoose/MongoDB</h3>
<p>The first thing we implemented today was the ability for the database to use timestamps. This was super simple and only involved adding an options object as an argument when creating the Schema for a model.</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">timestamps</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What this does is add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">createdAt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">updatedAt</code> field to each item created in the database.</p>

      <h3>July 30th & 31st 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Since I was so interested in making my idea work, I spent this week diving into finishing my simple Budgeting/Text Messaging app instead of my regular developer course work I normally do. For today’s post I will give you an overview of the project and what I did to accomplish the goals I had when I set out.</p>
=======
      <h3>August 13th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Wow. What a week! Since last Tuesday up until this morning my time has been spent setting up, rehearsing, performing, and  setting down from my Art Spark performance. It was the best musical performance and activity I have ever had the privilege to participate in! If you’d like to check out some of that info, feel free to browse through my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/skiesspeakband">artist facebook page</a></p>
>>>>>>> e6e73ea8e0c28e3e194830e94f64e2df704cd413

<p>Now that I’m finished with the performance aspect of the grant, I will be able to devote more time to learning to code. So, lets move on!</p>

<h3 id="uploading-files-with-multer-npm-package">Uploading files with multer npm package</h3>
<p>The first part of my learning today was back to the uploading files section of the node course. We are doing this by using the multer npm package. I started off today with a challenge to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Limit the upload size to 1MB</li>
  <li>Only allow jpg, jpeg, or png files</li>
</ol>
