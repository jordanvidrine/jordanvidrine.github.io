    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,
      and custom forms. We integrated google sheets and email for a reservation system allowed the client to save money
      by not using a pay per month reservation system.

      <h3>May 9th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Today was an office day at my day job. On my breaks I looked more into github and how to create a repository using Git Bash on windows. I created the <a href="https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey">coding-journey</a> repository on my work pc and documented the work I completed on 5-8-19.</p>

      <h3>May 8th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Today I read through <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">Chapter 5</a> of eloquent Javascript. It solidified a lot of the things about callbacks and higher-order functions in the udemy course I finished last month. I was able to solve the exercises at the end of the book without much struggle.</p>
