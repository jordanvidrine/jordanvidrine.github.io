    <h3>Stock Charting App</h3>
    <p>
      I am a noob when it comes to investing, trusting the sage of advice of Warren Buffet to put 90% into an S&P 500 etf and 10% into bonds. That being said, the data for stocks is super interesting to me so I wanted to create something utilizing an API.

    <h3>Drum Machine React App</h3>
    <p>
      This was something I wanted to create as a challenge for myself right as I began to learn how to code.
      Unfortunately I had no idea where to begin. After 3 months of learning, this wasnt
      difficult it helped me to see the progress I have made since starting this journey.

    <h3>Pomodoro React App</h3>
    <p>
      I created this app as an exercise to create a Pomodoro Method timer with Javascript and React.
      The user can set how long his/her breaks and work sessions should be. As the sessions are completed,
      a series of “Pomodoros” are filled in, showing the user how close they are to the finish of their work
      session.

    <h3>Nested Todolist App</h3>

      a Todo List app that could also create nested todos.

      I redesigned this client's website to better cater to their market. Using HTML + CSS, I made use of image galleries, google maps integrations,
      and custom forms. We integrated google sheets and email for a reservation system allowed the client to save money
      by not using a pay per month reservation system.

      <h3>July 1st 2019</h3>
      <p><p>I have decided to reformat most if not all journal entries from today foward to act more like a note taking platform and a more detailed description of what I am learning. I will be updating throughout my day, rather than at the end of the day.</p>

<p>This morning I went through a couple more hours of the Node.js course, and dove into MongoDB and how to get mongodb up and running in a node application and how to perform CRUD operations. I also learned how to utilize Promises, rather than proving a callback to each method, which makes things a lot less convoluted and easier to understand.</p>

<p>For example purposes lets pretend all of the following code is nested inside of the following call to MongoClient.connect The calls to console in the Then and Catch statements are for debugging purposes only.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">MongoClient</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">connectionURL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">useNewUrlParser</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">client</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

      <h3>June 28th 2019</h3>
      <p><p>Today was a short one coding wise. Looked over the horoku/git commands to run and pull/push the apps I’ve been working on to another computer.</p>

<p>I styled the my Stock Charting app for mobile use and implemented responsive styling for the Chart.js app that I seemed to look over when designing it earlier this week. I love how it turned out. Take a look at it <a href="https://jbv-stock-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a></p>
